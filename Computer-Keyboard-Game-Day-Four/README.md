# Brief

In this project, I was asked to create a computer keyboard game. A random key on the keyboard will jiggle and when the user types that key, it will stop jiggling and a new key on the computer will start to jiggle.


**Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- The user should also be able to click the key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling
