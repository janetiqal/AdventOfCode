# Advent Of JavaScript

I signed up for the Advent of JavaScript Challenge to practice my JavaScript skills. 

From December 1st to December 24th, a new challenge is released that outlines a JavaScript challenge. Each of the given challenges include all of the HTML and CSS needed to get started. 

I hope to keep my JS skills sharp by completing each of these challenges.
