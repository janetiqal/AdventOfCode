# Brief

In this project, I was asked to create a keyboard. The CSS and HTML was already provided, I made it functional using JS.

**Users should be able to:**

- See the keyboard centered on the page
- Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors
  - White keys will change to yellow `#ffd200`
  - Black keys will change to pink `#f40082`
- When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.
  - The audio clips are numbered, but they don't have to
