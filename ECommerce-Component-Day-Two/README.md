# Brief

In this project, we're creating an eCommerce component.
**Users should be able to:**

- View the plates on the left side of the screen and add them to your cart on the right side.
- When there are no plates within your cart, you should see a message that says, "Your cart is empty."
- When a plate is added to your cart, the Subtotal and Totals will automatically update.
- When products are in your cart, you should be able to increase and decrease the quantity.
  - A user should not be able to mark the quantity as a negative number.
  - If the quantity goes down to 0, the user will have the option to delete or remove the product for their cart entirely.
- Tax is based on Chicago's sales tax of 10.25%
